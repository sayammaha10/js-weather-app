Weather App  
This is a simple **Weather App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to get real-time weather updates for any city by fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and changes weather icons dynamically based on current conditions.

Features  
**Real-time Weather Data:** Fetches temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the searched city.  
**Dynamic Weather Icons:** Displays distinct icons for different weather conditions (clear, rain, clouds, etc.).  
**Error Handling:** Shows an error message when an invalid city is entered.  
**Responsive Design:** Works well on both mobile and desktop devices.  
**Intuitive User Interface:** Modern gradient background, clean layout, and easy-to-use search.

Technologies Used  
**HTML:** For structuring the app’s content.  
**CSS:** For styling, layout (Flexbox), and responsive design.  
**JavaScript:** For handling API calls, updating the UI dynamically, and managing user interactions.

Thank you for checking out my **Weather App**! I’m excited to share this project as part of my journey learning API integration and front-end development. Your feedback and suggestions are always appreciated as I continue to learn and grow in this field!
